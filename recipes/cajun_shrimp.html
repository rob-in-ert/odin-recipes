    <h3>How to cook</h3>

    <p>
        Prepare any halved corn cobs, potatoes, etc, to be included by boiling and 
        setting aside. Heat precooked sausage or kielbasa to be included and set 
        aside. Bring pot of water with rosemary to a boil and add your shrimp. Do 
        the same with any other shellfish options. Once all of the shrimp is pink 
        and white in color, strain and let cool slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
        In a sauce pan, use low heat to melt butter and with garlic mixed in.
        Wait for all the butter to melt and let it heat up with the garlic for
        a few minutes. Add the premixed spices to the butter and let it all heat
        up, constantly stirring. Keep the sauce at low heat and squeeze in lemon
        before removing. Put all food in one or more 1 gal freezer bags and
        distribute sauce evenly in bags. Shake bags until contents are well
        covered and ready to serve.
