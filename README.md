In the recipes project I will demonstrate my understanding of and ability to execute basic functions of html tools that I hqve learned from TheOdinProject.com.
I will create a webpage with html5 using various elements, tags, and attributes to format the site itself and the information I present.
This information will include absolute links, relative links, and images. Some text and images will also contain tags or attributes useful for web searches or screen readers.
