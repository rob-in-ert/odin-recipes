    <h3 class="howtos">How to cook and assemble</h3>
        <p>
            Rinse and cook rice as normal (15-20 min). Sprinkle cooked rice with 1-2 
            tablespoons of rice vinegar, fluff, and set aside until assembly. Cut your
            sushi grade fish and other filler into appropriately sized pieces- to the 
            length of the roll when possible.
        </p>
        <p>
            To assemble, lay one sheet of seaweed shiny side down onto the sushi mat.
            Cover the entire sheet with rice, leaving about 1 top inch bare. Top the
            rice with filler ingredients, as well as the protein or other main ingredient.
            Roll the sushi from top to bottom, making sure to keep it tight. Wrap each
            roll in saran wrap and refridgerate until it is ready to cut. To cut use a 
            serrated knife, moistening the blade before starting.
