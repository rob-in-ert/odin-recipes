    <h3>How to cook</h3>
        <p>
            Firstly, make a pico de gallo by chopping half an onion, dicing a 
            whole tomato, and a chopping half a bunch of cilantro. Mix it all with 
            half or a whole lemon and salt to taste. Refridgerate until serving time.
            Chop red cabbage and avocado into thin slices, if desired.
        </p>
        <p>
            Choose your preferred filet of fish and season heavily. Pan fry, bake, 
            grill, or broil your fish according to the internet. Remove from cooking 
            medium and split/mash the meat side of the fillet with the edge of your
            spatula. Warm tortillas on a skillet and keep them warm in between a serving 
            towel. To serve, top a warmed tortilla with fish, pico de gallo and/or
            cabbage and avocado.
